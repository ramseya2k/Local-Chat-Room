This chat room involves using the socket modules from python to establish a server-side connection vs client-side connection.


To execute the script it is recommend to run it in a terminal and execute by typing 'python server.py' and 'python client.py'.

Upon execution for the client-side it will prompt the user for a username, and is able to type a message. When another user connects and types,
the message won't exactly be seen instantly, so it is recommended to press enter again to see the users message.

For the server-side it establishes a record of the username, with the IP and its port it connected to, and keeps a message history along with who disconnected.
